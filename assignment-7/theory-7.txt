POSTMAN ----
Postman is an API(application programming interface) development tool which helps to build, test and modify APIs. Almost any functionality that could be needed by any developer is encapsulated in this tool. It is used by over 5 million developers every month to make their API development easy and simple. It has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH), saving environments for later use, converting the API to code for various languages(like JavaScript, Python). 

Why use Postman?
Postman is based on a wide range of extremely user-friendly power tools. For more than 8 million users, Postman has become a tool of convenience. Following are the reasons why Postman is used:

Accessibility- One can use it anywhere after installing Postman into the device by simply logging in to the account.
Use Collections-Postman allows users to build collections for their API-calls. Every set can create multiple requests and subfolders. It will help to organize the test suites.
Test development- To test checkpoints, verification of successful HTTP response status shall be added to every API- calls.
Automation Testing-Tests can be performed in several repetitions or iterations by using the Collection Runner or Newman, which saves time for repeated tests.
Creating Environments- The design of multiple environments results in less replication of tests as one can use the same collection but for a different setting.
Debugging- To effectively debug the tests, the postman console helps to track what data is being retrieved.
Collaboration- You can import or export collections and environments to enhance the sharing of files. You may also use a direct connection to share the collections.
Continuous integration-It can support continuous integration.
